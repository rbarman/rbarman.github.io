Title: Getting started with OSM

I have recently been interested in open source mapping and started to contribute to Open Street Map.

**[Map Roulette](https://maproulette.org/)** contains different challenges. Right now I do very basic challenges that fix metadata about a location such as phone numbers or websites. There are more complex channels where you need to create new nodes or connections between objects.

**[StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete)** is an app that shows you nearby challenges to fix existing OSM metadata. For example if you are walking in a park, the app pulls incomplete metadata about objects in the area (street condition, crossings, etc), and shows that there are things you can fix.

**[EveryDoor](https://github.com/Zverik/every_door)** is an app that lets you easily create new objects in OSM. For example I have added benches in a nearby park. There are existing schemas for common objects, so the creation process is very minimal for me.

**Future**

If I have time, here are some ways I plan to contribute more:

- Complete harder challenges in MapRoulette
- Try challenges in [Humanitarian OpenStreet Team](https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore). These are more challenging but have significant impact.
- Create my own version of StreetComplete where it prompts you to find a specific object or create new objects. This creates a more active role.
- Bulk upload basic metadata for stores in an area. 
- Upload GPS traces for parks and trails.
