</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In general, we want companies with high Return On Equity (ROE) and low Acquier's Multiple (AM). We can assign rank to each company based on ROE and AM (rank = ROE rank + AM rank). The book claims that high ranked companies perform well.</p>
<p><strong>ROE</strong> is a way to measure company growth</p>
<p>ROE = Operating Income / Equity</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong> is a way to get a fair price.</p>
<p>AM = Enterprise Value / Operating Income = "Price you pay" / "Value you get"</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise value is the total cost of shares <em>and</em> debt. When we buy a company, you must also service the debt. This is different than Market Cap which is just the price to buy all shares.</li>
<li>Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Cap + Debt - Cash</li>
<li>We prefer low EV, so high debt values are penalized</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In general, a highly profitable industry attracts more competition which ultimately lowers the profitability. Firms are a victim to this mean reversion of profitability. Investors like Warren Buffet try to find wonderful companies with a moat which prevent the companies from the mean reversion and remain highly profitable. However the book claims that it is very difficult to identify companies with moats. </p>
<p>It is more productive to look for companies that are priced at a discount to value. One method is to use the price to book value ratio. </p>
<ul>
<li>Price / Book Value</li>
<li>Book Value = value of assets - value of liabilities</li>
<li>lower ratio means greater bargains</li>
</ul>
<p>If we believe in mean reversion, then the price will eventually hit the valuation. If we purchase companies at steep discounts, then we get high returns. The major problem is that deeply discounted companies may be "value traps" or may take a long time to fully appreciate.</p>                </article>
